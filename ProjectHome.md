Tachyon (working title!) is a turn-based strategy game set in space.  The vision is that it will play like a really cool game of chess.  We'll see how that goes.

It's written in C++, currently depending only on OGRE and CEGUI.  It can currently only be built within CodeBlocks, although setting up a build solution is pretty easy at this point.  It will hopefully be portable across all versions of Linux and Windows at all stages of development.

More than anything, this game is intended to be a learning experience.
